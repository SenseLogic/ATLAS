# Atlas

In-view navigation plugin for Obsidian.

## Description

In reading mode, adds to the title of the currently opened note :
*   a breadcrumb of parent note links;
*   a list of child note links.

This allows to :
*   quickly navigate up and down through the notes directly from them;
*   easily create parent folder notes, by clicking on their link in the breadcrumb.

## Installation

*   In your vault folder, create a `.obsidian/plugins/atlas` subfolder.
*   Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` inside this subfolder.
*   Enable the Atlas plugin from the `Community plugins` settings panel.

## Limitations

*   The links appear some time after the note, since they can't be added to its title before it is already rendered.
