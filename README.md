# Atlas

In-view navigation plugin for Obsidian.

## Description

In reading mode, this plugin dynamically adds a parent note list and a child note list around the opened note title.

This allows to quickly navigate up and down through the note hierarchy directly from their rendering view, and also to easily create parent folder notes by simply clicking on them in the list.

## Installation

*   In your vault folder, create a `.obsidian/plugins/atlas` subfolder.
*   Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` inside this subfolder.
*   Enable the Atlas plugin from the `Community plugins` settings panel.

## Limitations

*   Those lists appear after the note content itself, since they must be added after is already rendered.
