# Atlas

Notion-like navigation plugin for Obsidian.

## Description

In reading mode, this plugin dynamically adds a parent note list and a child note list around the opened note title, so you can :

*   Quickly navigate up and down through the note hierarchy directly from the reading view.
*   Create parent folder notes by simply clicking on them in the list.
*   Create child notes through the "New child note" option of the opened note file menu (â‹®).

## Installation

*   In your vault folder, create a `.obsidian/plugins/atlas` subfolder.
*   Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` inside this subfolder.
*   Enable the Atlas plugin from the `Community plugins` settings panel.
